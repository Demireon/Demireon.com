# Demireon.com

My personal website, built using React and GatsbyJS.

### Deployment

I am using Netlify for my static hosting, and have a continuous integration/deployment pipeline set up directly from my Git repository to my domain Demireon.com.

### Performance

Gatsby is a blazing fast static site generator. With a few tweaks, it scores very highly on Google's site performance analyzer, Lighthouse.

### TODO

* Reach for 100 performance score on Lighthouse
* Add PWA support
